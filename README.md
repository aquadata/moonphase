# moonphase - A collection of implementations of an algorithm that gets the moon phase

Impls:

* C
* Lua

# Constraints

The function must be called `moonphase` with 1 argument as input

This input should either be in the programming languages date format, or as a fractional number
of julian days.

The output should be an angle such that `(1-cos(x))/2` returns the illuminated fraction of the moons surface
