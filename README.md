# Rules for submission of [Favorite Language Here]

## The Copy and Paste Rule

Your function must be self-contained, such that someone could copy-paste
it into their code and not get an error. It also must not effect the
environment outside it if at all possible (no `#define` or mutating globals).
It must be as "pure" and self-contained as the language will allow.

## The plumbing rule

Your code should take a time (ideally in the programming languages
time format) and output a value such that `(1-cos(x)/2`
is the illuminated fraction of the moons surface.
